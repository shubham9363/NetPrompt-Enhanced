    5. Return only valid P4 code with no explanations or comments.
    
    **Step 1: Problem Breakdown**
    Think through the problem carefully. What are the key components needed for the P4 implementation?
    
    **Step 2: Logical Plan**
    Outline how the program will be structured before writing the code.
    
    **Step 3: Generate the final P4 code**
